<h1>You May Fall Victim</h1>
</header>

<p>One brisk day, as I was making my rounds downtown, I was hurriedly stopped by a man whose face and dress have long evaporated from memory. I do not remember speaking to him, and though it is certain that he said some words to me, it was typical enough street talk to have been immediately forgotten, for I do not even remember ever remembering them. What was striking, though, was the peculiar document he handed me: a Xeroxed collection of affidavits and miscellaneous medical reports, including x-rays with scrawled-on addenda. It seemed as hastily put together as it was pamphleteered, offering little cohesion. What was evident, however, was the incarceratingly-deep paranoia that left a mark on every page. Nikolay Samsonov, the work's apparent compiler, was mentally trapped in a James Bond and Michael Crichton crossover set in the Bay Area.</p>

<p>The essence of the document is that an upper-middle-aged cabal of at least six Russian supercriminals are attacking former dissidents by implanting radio transmitters into the body. Nikolay himself claimed to have had a brain implantation, which he states to have been performed via a flushing of water through his ear canal. Through such surgical operations, these spies were to have supposedly been able to instigate a coup against the United States Government, provided that the devices were implanted into elected officials. As for Nikolay, his role in the takedown was to be a benefactor through extortion through monthly payments of $200, which he refused to pay: a risky maneuver considering the undercover agents poised to kill and assume Nikolay's name and life story.</p>

<p>Nikolay, seemingly understanding the risks he faced and authored, names six of the spies, giving ages for each and approximating their immigration date. Others&emdash;or perhaps this same group&emdash;"may [have worked] as nurses" at local hospitals, equipped with the tools they needed for electronic implantation and subsequent torture.</p>

<p>But one needn't interrogate hospital staff to gain insight into these crimes: they themselves, with staggering audacity, had it all written down and published in a book, implied to be titled <cite>The Terminal Man</cite>!</p>

<p>Since <a href="http://www.plainsite.org/flashlight/case.html?id=43533">at least as early as 2007</a>, and as recent as as at least 2012, Nikolay has cried out repeatedly for justice, but the government has done nothing but <a href="http://www.rfcexpress.com/lawsuits/other-personal-injury/california-northern-district-court/319937/nikolay-n-samsonov-v-federal-bureau-of-investigations/official-court-documents/">dismissed his cases</a>.</p>

            Those Russian speaking commie-nazi criminals demand $10000
            in racket money from disabled persons. When refused to pay,
            criminals begin slowly murder disabled by using powerfull
            ultrasound guns and implanted radio mikes in larynx
            (subvocal speech) and inner ears of the victims.

        <h1>Declaration</h1>
        <p>(This form must be attached to another form or court paper before it can be filed in court.)</p>
        <p>
            There is a gang of international com<del>m</del>unist-fascist
            conspirators that terrorize former dissidents against soviets, 
            some of them disabled, by implanting micro transmitters with speakers
            & micro listening devices into various parts of their bodies (ears,
            larynx, back of the neck). When they put them into the brain, they do
            this by using water to pump these devices in through the ears. I am fell
            victim to this horrible crime. At first <u>this</u> losers ask me to pay $10000
            in extortion money, then later $200 monthly, but I strongly refuse to pay.
            In the process they cynically decide to write a book about this crime.
            Also they may affect my brain <u>waives</u> or brain frequencies to influence my
            heart and reproductive functions in <u>harm</u> way.This electronic torture
            starts in may 2005 and since then I heard their threats to kill me daily and 18 hours non-stop
            (every second) in a raw. This radio attack imposes great stress and permanent damage
            to my brain and nervous system. At a time they pressure me to commit suicide.
            They promise to imitate suicide (as a killing method), or release
            deadly amount of drug from the implanted dispenser. After killing me,
            they have gangsters (possibly from the Russian mafia), take my place
            & assume my identity and life story. To cover these crimes, perpetrators
            may work as nurses at a <a href="https://plus.google.com/109095500999910557963/about?gl=us&hl=en">San Francisco General Hospital</a> 
            or any hospital in Bay area.

            Finally <u>this conspirator's</u> said wants to put American government
            down and make communist or fascist revolution using these devices on elected officials.
            <u>Hardly</u> to believe, but those persons operate freely over radio
            spectrum, and they may transmit from Russian consulate. The names of
            conspirators who immigrate to the USA in 1990s are:
