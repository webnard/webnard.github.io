<h1>You May Fall Victim</h1>
</header>

<p>In 2009, a man whom I assume to have been Nikolay N. Samsonov approached me on a street corner in downtown San Francisco and handed me, from a stack of the same, a few stapled pages. The documents were all scans from originals, one of them turned upside down, and a few bore scrawled-on addenda. These were copies of x-rays, a lawsuit, and some bold-print warnings. What for? Nikolay was proving to the people of San Francisco, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, of the existence of a gang of Russian supercriminals in the United States, men who infiltrated hospitals and inserted rogue tracking bugs into the bodies of unsuspecting patients. Nikolay was a victim himself.</p>

<p>Since <a href="http://www.plainsite.org/flashlight/case.html?id=43533">at least as early as 2007</a>, and as recent as as at least 2012, Nikolay has cried out repeatedly for justice, but the government has done nothing but <a href="http://www.rfcexpress.com/lawsuits/other-personal-injury/california-northern-district-court/319937/nikolay-n-samsonov-v-federal-bureau-of-investigations/official-court-documents/">dismissed his cases</a>.</p>

<p>If you are disaffected by the inability of the judicial system to bring to justice the middle-aged crooks destroying our country, then maybe it's time for vigilantism. There "may be" a huge bounty waiting as your reward.</p>

<p>You can view Nikolay's <a href="you-may-fall-victim.pdf">document (about 3MB).</a> Transcript follows.</p>
