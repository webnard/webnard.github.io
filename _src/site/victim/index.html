<h1>You May Fall Victim</h1>
</header>

<p>In 2009, a man whom I assume to have been Nikolay N. Samsonov approached me on a street corner in downtown San Francisco and handed me, from a stack of the same, a few stapled pages. The documents were all scans from originals, one of them turned upside down, and a few bore scrawled-on addenda. These were copies of x-rays, a lawsuit, and some bold-print warnings. What for? Nikolay was proving to the people of San Francisco, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, of the existence of a gang of Russian supercriminals in the United States, men who infiltrated hospitals and inserted rogue tracking bugs into the bodies of unsuspecting patients. Nikolay was a victim himself.</p>

<p>Since <a href="http://www.plainsite.org/flashlight/case.html?id=43533">at least as early as 2007</a>, and as recent as as at least 2012, Nikolay has cried out repeatedly for justice, but the government has done nothing but <a href="http://www.rfcexpress.com/lawsuits/other-personal-injury/california-northern-district-court/319937/nikolay-n-samsonov-v-federal-bureau-of-investigations/official-court-documents/">dismissed his cases</a>.</p>

<p>If you are disaffected by the inability of the judicial system to bring to justice the middle-aged crooks destroying our country, then maybe it's time for vigilantism. There "may be" a huge bounty waiting as your reward.</p>

            Those Russian speaking commie-nazi criminals demand $10000
            in racket money from disabled persons. When refused to pay,
            criminals begin slowly murder disabled by using powerfull
            ultrasound guns and implanted radio mikes in larynx
            (subvocal speech) and inner ears of the victims.

        <p>
            There is a gang of international com<del>m</del>unist-fascist
            conspirators that terrorize former dissidents against soviets, 
            some of them disabled, by implanting micro transmitters with speakers
            & micro listening devices into various parts of their bodies (ears,
            larynx, back of the neck). When they put them into the brain, they do
            this by using water to pump these devices in through the ears. I am fell
            victim to this horrible crime. At first <u>this</u> losers ask me to pay $10000
            in extortion money, then later $200 monthly, but I strongly refuse to pay.
            In the process they cynically decide to write a book about this crime.
            Also they may affect my brain <u>waives</u> or brain frequencies to influence my
            heart and reproductive functions in <u>harm</u> way.This electronic torture
            starts in may 2005 and since then I heard their threats to kill me daily and 18 hours non-stop
            (every second) in a raw. This radio attack imposes great stress and permanent damage
            to my brain and nervous system. At a time they pressure me to commit suicide.
            They promise to imitate suicide (as a killing method), or release
            deadly amount of drug from the implanted dispenser. After killing me,
            they have gangsters (possibly from the Russian mafia), take my place
            & assume my identity and life story. To cover these crimes, perpetrators
            may work as nurses at a <a href="https://plus.google.com/109095500999910557963/about?gl=us&hl=en">San Francisco General Hospital</a> 
            or any hospital in Bay area.

            Finally <u>this conspirator's</u> said wants to put American government
            down and make communist or fascist revolution using these devices on elected officials.
            <u>Hardly</u> to believe, but those persons operate freely over radio
            spectrum, and they may transmit from Russian consulate. The names of
            conspirators who immigrate to the USA in 1990s are:
