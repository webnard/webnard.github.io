I do not remember speaking to him, and though it is certain that he said some words to me, it was typical enough street talk to have been immediately forgotten, for I do not even remember ever remembering them. What was striking, though, was the peculiar document he handed me: a Xeroxed collection of affidavits and miscellaneous medical reports, including x-rays with scrawled-on addenda. It seemed as hastily put together as it was pamphleteered, offering little cohesion. What was evident, however, was the incarceratingly-deep paranoia that left a mark on every page. Nikolay Samsonov, the work's apparent compiler, was mentally trapped in a James Bond and Michael Crichton crossover set in the Bay Area.</p><p>The essence of the document is that an upper-middle-aged cabal of at least six Russian supercriminals are attacking former dissidents by implanting radio transmitters into the body. Nikolay himself claimed to have had a brain implantation, which he states to have been performed via a flushing of water through his ear canal. Through such surgical operations, these spies were to have supposedly been able to instigate a coup against the United States Government, provided that the devices were implanted into elected officials. As for Nikolay, his role in the takedown was to be a benefactor through extortion through monthly payments of $200, which he refused to pay: a risky maneuver considering the undercover agents poised to kill and assume Nikolay's name and life story.</p><p>Nikolay, seemingly understanding the risks he faced and authored, names six of the spies, giving ages for each and approximating their immigration date. Others—or perhaps this same group—“may [have worked] as nurses” at local hospitals, equipped with the tools they needed for electronic implantation and subsequent torture.</p><p>But one needn't interrogate hospital staff to gain insight into these crimes: they themselves, with staggering audacity, had it all written down and published in a book, implied to be titled<cite>The Terminal Man</cite>!</p><p>Since <a href="http://www.plainsite.org/flashlight/case.html?id=43533">at least as early as 2007</a>, and as recent as as at least 2012, Nikolay has cried out repeatedly for justice, but the government has done nothing but <a href="http://www.rfcexpress.com/lawsuits/other-personal-injury/california-northern-district-court/319937/nikolay-n-samsonov-v-federal-bureau-of-investigations/official-court-documents/">dismissed his cases</a>.</p><p>You may download the <a href="you-may-fall-victim.pdf">scanned PDF (~3MB) of Nikolay's document</a>.

When they put them into the brain, they do this by using water to pump these devices in through the ears. I am fell victim to this horrible crime. At first <u>this</u> losers ask me to pay $10000 in extortion money, then later $200 monthly, but I strongly refuse to pay. In the process they cynically decide to write a book about this crime. Also they may affect my brain <u>waives</u> or brain frequencies to influence my heart and reproductive functions in <u>harm</u> way.This electronic torture starts in may 2005 and since then I heard their threats to kill me daily and 18 hours non-stop (every second) in a raw. This radio attack imposes great stress and permanent damage to my brain and nervous system. At a time they pressure me to commit suicide. They promise to imitate suicide (as a killing method), or release deadly amount of drug from the implanted dispenser. After killing me, they have gangsters (possibly from the Russian mafia), take my place &amp; assume my identity and life story. To cover these crimes, perpetrators may work as nurses at a <a href="https://plus.google.com/109095500999910557963/about?gl=us&amp;hl=en">San Francisco General Hospital</a> or any hospital in Bay area.</p><p>Finally <u>this conspirator's</u> said wants to put American government down and make communist or fascist revolution using these devices on elected officials. <u>Hardly</u> to believe, but those persons operate freely over radio spectrum, and they may transmit from Russian consulate.
